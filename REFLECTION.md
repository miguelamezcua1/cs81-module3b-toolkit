## Reflection: Math Toolkit Project

At the beginning of this assignment, I didn’t know much about JavaScript functions. I just followed the steps and built each one little by little. It helped me understand how functions take input and return output.

One thing I noticed is that most math functions follow simple logic, like doubling a number or checking if it’s even. But even simple functions need to be tested to make sure they work. I also learned that it’s important to break things down and test as I go, not just write everything all at once.

The most confusing part was making sure each function worked the way I expected. Sometimes I had to slow down and really think through the logic, especially with `isEven()` and `isOdd()` — it was easy to mix them up.

Now I see why developers use toolkits like this. Once you have a bunch of small, working functions, you can reuse them for bigger problems. This kind of toolkit would be useful in larger projects where math or number checks are needed a lot.

Overall, this project made me more confident in using functions and thinking about code in smaller, testable pieces.
